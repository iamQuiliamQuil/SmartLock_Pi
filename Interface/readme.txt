This is an artifact from the original design.  
May or may not be useful.  
The original intent was to implement the same programming laguage between the pi and the app  
A .NET project written in C# (the same as the app (minus the xaml))  
Initially we tried to send messages through bluetooth using a C# library which would use the same code accross the pi and the app  
The interface would then execute simple python scripts to operate hardware instead of having everything in python as it is now.  
We could not figure out how to use this library so it was scrapped.
